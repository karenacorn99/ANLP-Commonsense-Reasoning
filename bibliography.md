Created by Keen You (keen.you@yale.edu)
### Overview
***
Here's a curated list of resources that are related to commonsense learning and reasoning in NLP. This list is by no means exhaustive, but it should serve the purpose of helping one build a foundation for understanding additional materials and further research in the area. Note that the categorization is meant for easier lookup and not definitive as many works fit into multiple categories.
